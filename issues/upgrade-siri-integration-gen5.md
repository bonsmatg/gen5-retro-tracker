### Upgrade Siri Integration for Gen 5 and Network-Based AI Features

This issue involves upgrading Siri to align with Gen 5 project requirements and integrating network-based AI features. The scope of the upgrades includes:

1. Enhanced voice recognition for new commands specific to Gen 5.
2. AI localization within devices for reduced latency and improved privacy.
3. Network-based feature upgrades to enable better synchronization across devices.
4. Device-specific customization to leverage hardware capabilities of Gen 5 devices.
5. Collaboration and integration with other projects (e.g., bhujang, doos, etc.).

#### Tasks:
- Develop custom voice commands for all integrated devices.
- Implement multi-language support for broader usability.
- Optimize AI models for both on-device and network-based processing.
- Test the upgraded Siri system across all Gen 5 devices.

This issue serves as a collaborative effort across multiple repositories and projects.
